Version: 1.2
Author: Roman CHACORNAC

Instructions
Add the "VFX_Fire.prefab" to your scene.

Drag the prefab into the scene either directly from your project folder or by instantiating it in the hierarchy.
Locate the parent GameObject, which contains the VFX_FireController script.
Attach it to your character controller (or any other object as needed) to allow real-time interaction with the particle system.
VFX_FireController Script
This package includes a script attached to the parent of the VFX prefab. The script allows real-time customization of various particle system parameters for the fire effect. You can adjust the color, intensity, and size of the particles, as well as the wind direction.

Features
Fire Color Control: Use a color picker to dynamically adjust the color of the particles and the light, giving a realistic fire appearance.
Fire Intensity Adjustment: A slider lets you control the overall intensity of the fire, affecting both the particle emission rate and the light intensity.
Particle Size Modification: Customize the size of the particles based on intensity, providing flexible control for subtle or dramatic effects.
Wind Simulation: Apply a velocity force to influence the direction of the particles, simulating wind effects on the flames.
Customizable Parameters
Fire Color: Choose the color of the fire for both the particles and the light.
Fire Intensity: Control the overall intensity of the fire, affecting both the emission rate of particles and the light intensity.
Fire Wind Direction: Set the wind direction to influence the particle trajectories using the velocity over lifetime module.
Compatibility
This package is compatible with Unity 2022.3.59f1 and later versions. It is designed for use with the Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

Installation
Download and import the package into your Unity project.
Add the "VFX_Fire.prefab" to your scene.
Modify the parameters of the VFX_FireController script in the Inspector to customize the fire to your liking.
